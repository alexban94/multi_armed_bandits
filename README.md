# Multi-armed Bandits
C++ implementation of the multi-armed bandit problem as described in Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Sutton and Barto).

TODO: fix optimal action, which should be the action with the greatest q*(a) value, as its distribution is most likely to give the best result. Set this in the constructor.
